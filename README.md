# Modifying the thinkpad 13 Gen 1 to unlock its full pcie potential
A Few weeks ago i acquired a Thinkpad 13 gen 1 on ebay, sold by a recycling company, it was listed for parts
and with the wrong model name in the title.
Math done it only cost about 33 euro shipped so i decided to buy to check out what was wrong with it,
as soon as it arrived i plugged it in to check for any signs of life and it immediately turned on, at the time
i did not have an ssd to test it with so i only checked it out using a usb stick equipped with a live image of linux.
Passed some time i forgot about the laptop until recently when i finally decided to test it with an ssd
